# cshome - UWA's csse page redesign
I got so annoyed using csmarks & the help forums I decided to try make it look more modern.

# What is going on with the database
- This is a *fully* frontend react app. I am using an SQLite database to store the data, with drizzle & sql.js as the ORM.
- The database is seeded with some dummy data in the public folder which is fetched on website load.
